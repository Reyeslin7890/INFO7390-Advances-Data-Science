        "There's no mistaking it - this isn't the phone for someone who wants lots of features. There isn't even a speakerphone or multiple hand sets. But what this phone does offer is an undistorted, crystal clear, natural voice quality and a solid, reliable connection that never chops up or disconnects while you are in range of the base. While this might not sound out of the ordinary, I've experienced problems with several other brands of phones much more expensive than this one. I've had digitally chopped up audio and lost the handset connection with several other brands of DECT cordless phones even while in the same room. Now I expect these problems at the fringes of the range of any cordless phone, because they are, after all, nothing more than duplexed two way radios in a handset.Range seems to be midway in the pack. You'll get clear, uninterrupted communication in most large homes with two floors, and it will cover most two acre yards. If you're close, you will even be able to use it at your neighbor's house. If you live on a hundred acre ranch, this probably won't reach the back forty. Naturally, as with any wireless device, the proximity of the base to nearby objects or windows will affect the range.All the features like speakerphone and multi-handsets won't keep you happy when you frequently lose calls or can't hear the caller because their voice breaks up even when you're close to the base. Sure, I'd love all the features and good reliability too, but I can't seem to find both of those in one phone. It's true what they say, keep it simple and it will be more reliable. If you can forego the features, this is an excellent phone."

        "My grandpa insists on keeping his home phone even though he never uses it. It didn\u2019t help that he could barely hear it either. I figured if he\u2019s paying a phone bill every month he might as well be able to use it so I ordered this one since it had everything he needed and was a great price.It\u2019s a plain old phone line so it was simple to install. Just plug the base into a wall outlet and then plug the phone cord into the base (it even comes with a cord). The phone is up and running in seconds. To make it even easier for him I added a few phone numbers and names into the phone. This was surprisingly easy and only took a few minutes. This way he won\u2019t have to go looking for our numbers, plus our names will show when we call.His biggest issue is hearing so I set the ringer to high. It\u2019s loud enough that even he didn\u2019t have problems hearing it. The call volume is pretty loud and I found calls to be clear as well. He was able to hear well through the test calls I made him.The buttons are big enough that he\u2019s not accidentally pressing more than one button at a time. They\u2019re also easy to push (the other reason he needed a new phone). The phone comes with a small instruction manual so it\u2019s easier for him to get used to the phone.So far, he\u2019s happy with the phone. If anything changes I\u2019m sure he will let me know and I\u2019ll share an update. It\u2019s a simple phone that\u2019s just perfect for someone who doesn\u2019t want/need any extras. It\u2019s loud, has large enough buttons, and it\u2019s cordless. It feel like it was a great choice for him."

I got so frustrated with these sets were you buy 5 at a time and can't get them to work for very long. .  You simply plug in and you're ready to go. And you can keep adding a phone wherever you want. I've had one of these for almost ten years with no problems.  Easy to understand operation.  hang on the wall or place anywhere there's a plug. These have CID and are just wonderful in their attractiveness and simplicity.  I see myself as not ever switching to a different phone.  Life's too short and I hate having to read a tutorial.  I love the plug in and go!!!"

        "The phone deserves three stars but for the low price, it gets four. I purchased this model to connect to an Obi voip box using Google Voice. The family uses cell phones for everything so this is just a backup second line and used sparingly. The phone is as simple as it gets. Menus are basic with few options for customization. Sound quality is fair but usable. A nice feature is the handset locator button on the base which is visible when the phone is removed. The range is sufficient to cover the whole inside of my home. I have not tried walking down the street to see when it drops out.A couple negatives - the buttons are hard to push and the base is too light. Dialing too quickly usually results in missing a number. Slow deliberate presses are needed to be sure you dial correctly. The base, even with the phone on charge is very light and topples over easily. Obviously mounting to a wall fixes that. Despite its shortcomings, the phone has been reliable backup for a few months now. I don't think you can find a single cordless handset at a lower price than this. I would buy it again."

None of us have a cell phone (our choice) and so finding a good cordless telephone was a must.In short, this is a quality cordless telephone and fits my needs perfectly. It has Caller ID and Call Waiting options. But NO speaker phone.

        "We needed to add a home phone as we live in an area with spotty cell service. We looked for the cheapest thing we could that worked with our VOIP setup from Time Warner / Spectrum .  Apparently cheap means you cannot completely shut off the ringer. See kids, we are spoiled by the lack of cold calling on our cell phones. This thing gets like 5 calls a day from telemarkers. And since you cannot fully shut off the ringer, you have to hear the calls as they come in.Along with that, the menu and navigation is kind of wonky.As for making calls, they are clear, no echo. We have not had the phone drop calls and the battery seems to last a long time.  Since I will be staying with the cheap phone, I won't complain too much.

My old home phone was solid and heavy; this one is very light (like a children's play phone) which could be considered a good thing by some, but I prefer something more substantial.I don't know what I was expecting for the money, but based on the high reviews I guess I thought it would be better.

We don't use our home phone very much but it's nice to have one incase we need it. This phone works just as well as the last one and I expect it to last at least 10 years. It has good sound quality. It's easy to use in the dark since the number display lights up. It has caller ID and call waiting. It also has an answering machine which can store about 15 minutes of messages. The controls for the answering machine are clearly labeled, Delete, Skip, Play/Stop and Repeat. It has a locate handset button . The volume is adjustable and the buttons are clearly labeled. The handset  sits securely facing outward. This phone is very easy to use. It is definitely a good bang for your buck."

        "The phone worked fine at first.  Then after only 4 months of occasional use, the microphone started randomly making the speaker's voice very quiet, then would get loud again, then quiet.  In other words, there was some random problem with amplification of the speakers voice.  The battery showed full on the display, and another phone in the same jack works fine, so the problem is with this phone.Edited to add: I mailed the phone back to the company for warranty service even though I only netted a couple bucks after the postage I paid for, but I did get a new working phone.There is a curious quarter second delay with the beep when pushing a button, which is annoying.  The digital display with caller ID is hard to read for people who need glasses.  At least the ring is decent, in that I do not find it annoying.

It's a shame I didn't really use it until it was too late to return because it has some annoying issues:1. Want to see who's calling? You need to grab the phone and duck under a blanket or into a dark room. The display is so dim it's unreadable.2. Want to scroll through the list of recent callers? Get back under a blanket and try to figure out what button combo allows you to use this feature. Hitting the down arrow prompts me to enter speed dial numbers, when it really should the quick access to recently received calls.3. Want to quiet the ringer a bit or turn it off completely? Good luck with that. There is no basic Ringer on/off or volume control that can be accessed without reading the manual.The only good thing I can say is the phone does have decent sound quality and battery life."

It's reasonably clear and has a very slight feedback (I'm spoiled by cell phones) into the earpiece like most cheap landline phones have, but it's less feedback than the more pricey cordless phones I've used.There's a delay between pushing the keypad button (which has instant audible feedback for the phone itself) and hearing the corresponding tone for which specific number you've pushed, for the phone line.  If I dialed too quickly, it made me think I accidentally pushed a button twice or didn't push a button, so that's a small nuisance, but it's not enough to have me consider not buying this for an auxiliary phone."

        "My old VTech DECT 6.0 Cordless phone got sticky keys thanks to a lot of use. When I tried to clean under the keys one of them popped off and unlike computer keys, phone keys don't just snap back in. So....I had to quickly get a replacement since I rely on that phone to attend work conference calls every week.I was pleased to see the same model number CS6114 being offered on Amazon for a very low price. With my free 2-day Prime shipping, I thought it was perfect.Then I got the phone. Now, let me begin by clarifying that the phone is exactly how it is advertised and portrayed. So the small issues I have with it are really my own oversight. Also, buying items online without actually handling them is always a risk.The phone I am replacing has a smooth, shiny finish and more importantly; it has two indicator lights. One on the handset that tells you when it's charging and another on the base to tell you the phone is in use.The phone I am now reviewing has a rough finish and NO indicator lights. The reason the lights are a big deal to me is because I can't tell you how many times someone in my household has hurriedly placed the phone back on the base incorrectly so it didn't charge. The only reason I could correct the issue is because the light would be off even though I would see the handset presumably on the base. I would get up, walk across the living room and set it properly back until the light blinked on to indicate the handset was now charging. The light on the base that indicates the phone in use tells me that someone (usually my husband) was using the handset in another part of the house. This was useful for me if I got up and began looking around the living room for it but seeing the light told me that I could sit back down and just wait my turn.The rough finish of this newer phone is just kinda annoying but nothing that I can't live with. They can keep the rough finish but at least give me my lights back!So, there ya go. It's a cheap phone. It works well (the last one worked for a few years and probably still has many more years of life left in it if not for the sticky buttons which were my fault.) But if you, like me, are looking for the original CS6114 with the indication lights and smooth finish...this isn't the same one.Edited to Add: The original one with the indicator lights is actually model # CS6114-2 which appears to be difficult to find for sale anywhere right now. Not even Vtech's own website has it for sale, though you can see they still sell its accessories."

So for less than $25, I immediately purchased a voice mail phone and dropped the $4 voice mail feature from Comcast.

The number is in tiny print, LCD dark gray on light gray, and though it's backlit, it's not as bright as the lighting on the keypad (which really doesn't need backlighting). Another annoying feature is the need to press the \"TALK\" button: just taking the phone out of the cradle doesn't connect.

Anyway, they were using a cordless phone with a broken antenna, a battery with a short lifespan, and they would use a rubber band to hold it in place on the charger.  My mother's only condition was that it had to be \"white, beige, or bisque\".  I came to the sudden realization that there was a very limited selection of phones in this color being sold individually, and decided on this one after doing a little research.  My mother loves this phone.  She said she even likes the sound of the ring better than the old phone.  I answered it tonight in the dark, and love the inclusion of the backlight.I noticed that some people gave it a bad review based on their own ignorance.  You can read about the phone features BEFORE you actually go ahead and purchase the item.  If they had done this, they would have seen that this phone does not have a speakerphone, speed dial, an answering machine, or a headset jack.  This wasn't a problem for us.

So, you have to always have this handset clung to your ear if you wish to have a conversation.

The sound quality, the ringer tones, the volume, the outgoing message, the handset design and the base design are all a huge improvement over the old model.  The set up was easy.  The sound quality is clear and strong.  No more buzzes, static or other sounds.  There is a greater selection of ringer tones and volume which was an issue with the old phone.  I love the handset.  It fits my hand perfectly.  It looks great on my desk. I'm really delighted with this phone.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."

It looks good but there is no light in the box that tells who is calling, so unless there is bright light in the room I had no idea as to whom I would be talking to. I solved this problem by putting a flash light next to the phone .  I was also surprised that on the answering machine, I can not leave a message, it is prerecorded.I am keeping the phone since I rarely use the home phone, but I remember reading where someone had given this to their mother.  As a senior myself, I would not recommend it for seniors who wish to avoid answering calls from scammers."

I figured that since we have the phone service, I'd look for a cheap cordless phone to plug into the modem.  I figure it will save money on our cell phone bills if I use the house phone to make calls that require being on hold for a million years.  That's pretty much all I will use it for; I am not planning on giving out the number, and the ringer is turned OFF.The modem is upstairs, and the base is plugged into that.

        "Got this phone to replace a V-Tech phone I'd had for many years that finally died. Given the price I paid (12.99), I was not expecting anything spectacular, but I did expect it to work properly. The problem is in the keypad/dialing mechanism. I press a number key, then there is a delay followed by a softer secondary tone, and finally the number registers. If you try to enter numbers quickly, forget it!  A customer service rep was on a call with me for 20 minutes trying every possible change of setting, unplugging the power to the base, removing the battery to reset it, using a different phone line within my home, etc. Nothing solved the problem which she described as \"delay of buttons\", though I'm not so sure that's the technical term for it. The proposed solution? Send the phone back to them at my expense and they'll replace it.  It will cost me the price of the phone to send it back to them in the way they want it shipped!  When I asked why they would not send a return shipping label, since the customer service rep could verify that it was a defect in the phone, her only reply was, \"Sorry, but we don't do that.\" So I would give V-Tech a \"D\" for their combined defect and return policy, but an \"A\" for the training and patience of their customer service reps. Will I buy another V-Tech phone? Nope!  All of our other phones are Panasonic, and they have worked flawlessly."

The handset's shape is comfortable to hold, though not with just a shoulder.  One star was deducted for its styling, or lack thereof.  Designers do better than this, so why doesn't the manufacturer make those designs real?  An inexpensive and STYLISH phone would sell like hotcakes.  A little investment in a new molding could go a long way.  Consider the Panasonic 'retro' headphones, which were retro-styled, with great textures, over-the-ear, for only about $35.  They were on design blogs and sites everywhere.  VTech, we have seen good design from you.  This is good, but so very SAFE.  Okay, we still bought one."

Good phone,good reception no feedback very clear voice. Unlike other home phones you can *not* hear your self in the ear piece/phone speaker when talking all you get is the other person on the other end.I think it has 4 ring tones and even on lowest ringer setting its pretty LOUD. Cant complain needed a cheap house phone that does the job and this works!Other than the color (which I dont much care for) The display on the headset could be better/more legible, but the price more than makes up for it!

Personally, had I know this I probably wouldn't have purchased it since its a feature it turns out I use a lot. Our last phone was a Panasonic and it died on us, so we needed a quick and cheap replacement. This was that bad boy.After several weeks using it, there are certain things I love, certain things I hate, and certain things I'm still scratching my head about. Let me list these out:Love:*Semi-Loud ringer*Pager from the base*variety of ringtones*easy designHate:*Not very many features*poor battery life (And I mean poooooor)*Kinda quiet ringing if even a pillow is on top of it. Makes you search for it for hours if you misplaced it...Head Scratcher:*No Speaker....*No Speaker*No Speaker"

I have it directly connected to my internet modem, and my internet company tells me that, because I'm not DSL, the \"DSL Filter\" suggested to another reviewer wont help me.  After 2 months, it's bad enough that I have to buy a new phone.I'm still pleased with the light weight and range.  People say that my voice comes across very clearly.  So it seems the problem is just the speaker.  Unfortunately, the return period is only 1 month."

It works great. No frills, it doesn't brew your coffee in the morning, but it does what you pay for it to do. Easy to set up; voice carries through clearly on both ends; receiver is comfortable to grab and hold; numbers are clearly visible; you'll figure out how to use receiver and answer-phone without reading the instructions leaflet, because everything is self-evidently marked on the machine itself. I bought it for my office--I am very very rarely at the office, I practically receive ZERO calls there, but just in case someone decides to call instead of writing an email I have an actual telephone to store a message and let me know someone tried to reach me.

It's easily the worst phone I've ever owned, and I say that as someone who for years bought her phones at Goodwill. I'm actually already on my second one of these, as the first one stopped working entirely about two weeks after I got it. Amazon quickly replaced it - no complaints on that score - but the second one is not an improvement except insofar as it does actually make and receive calls.Specifics: the display is not backlit, so it is impossible to read it without picking it up and squinting at the screen. This means that when a call is coming in, the called ID is effectively useless. The alleged \"message waiting indicator\" is just text on the screen, so that is also impossible to see. You will not know if you have a message unless you regularly go over, pick up the handset, and squint at it. There's no speed dial, so in order to use the stored contacts you have to scroll through the entire list. The annoying dial delay and absence of a not-totally-grating ringtone hardly seem worth mentioning, but the fact that it disconnects when it's more than a few feet from the base is. It's like a corded phone, only ugly and irritating!I hate this phone. My advice is to either go entirely wireless, or shop eBay for a phone from the fifties, when they made them to actually work."

And although for some reason it says there's not a speaker phone function on this phone, the one we received did have speaker phone. So I'm not sure if they upgraded the model or sent a slightly different model, but ours did have a speaker phone function. It's nice and loud and clear, and my mom loves all the features on it. She can also operate the answering machine well and she likes that the buttons are big for being a cordless phone, so if you're looking for a decent phone for an older person, this one will probably do just fine. I don't know what our curse is with phones, but I hope this one lasts for a few years before I even have to look at another one."

In fact, my sister-in-law, father-in-law, and mother have the exact same setup and they all love it and have no complaints.The range seems good enough for me as I can take the phone outside of my house and down the street a little ways and I still have a good connection.  The battery seems to last a very long time.  It has a last 5 numbers dialed memory for redial.  This phone could use more ringer options or better tones than the four that it has but hey... it does the job.One thing that I could not get a straight answer on when deciding to buy this phone was the caller id.  If any of you use any of those free voip services, you know that they don't provide you with the callers name, but just the phone number.  This phone makes it possible to get at least 30 different names with numbers by saving them into the phones memory phone book, but will not use them for cnam lookup.  For example, if I saved \"Mom\" with the number 1-222-333-4444 then every time the number 1-222-333-4444 rang in, the phone would not match that number with my phones memory to display \"Mom\".  If I actually did have cnam service from my provider which sent the name \"Shaylese John\" with the number 1-222-333-4444, then the phone would still display \"Shaylese John\" for the caller id name.  That is a nice feature if you ask me, but this phone doesn't have it."

I don't use my landline often, but even if I go 2-3 days without using it at all, and the phone sits off the charger, the next time I go to use it (even if it shows it's fully charged) it starts giving me a very loud low battery beep (right in my ear!) after just a few minutes on the phone.

It will last for 2 or 3 days on a full charge, and the sound is clear with no static or distortion. I recently hooked up a fax machine, part of a printer, in my house, and the person who I spoke to about the service said that I could also hook a phone to the line at no extra cost. So, I decided to look here on Amazon to see how much one would cost me. I have been a cellular user for years, and didn't have any idea how much a cordless phone cost these days. I was pleasantly surprised to find this one which was highly rated, so I said what the heck,14 $ isn't going to break me, and I bought it. It works great, and so does my fax."

You should hear a short beep followed by a longer beep.Press Menu Select and the press the following without pause - *7890#You should now see Test Base at the top of the screen press the Vol up button until Test Handset is present.Press Menu/Select and you should see SW Version displayed.

Its three worst features: 1) it requires an electrical AND an RJ11 connection, and the combination is rare in my 100-yr-old apartment; when they do occur near each other, they often result in my tripping over the electric cord.  2) the screen is indecipherable; I have to hold my head at just the right angle to read it, and I've already increased the contrast as much as possible.  On occasion, I've tried to lift the whole set to read who's calling, and usually wind up disconnecting the call.  3) the base is too light.  It needs a LITTLE weight.  A mere brush of fabric will knock either the phone out of of its cradle or the entire apparatus off my dresser.  I've had this for two years and I'm just getting more and more frustrated with how--and where--to use it effectively.  I'm writing this now because I came to Amazon to look for a replacement for it, but seeing that it's your #1 seller, I'm already feeling pessimistic about my prospects."

I think it is the smart thing to do when older kids when a cell phone for all is not in the budget. I was so excited to get our phone and when it arrived we all opened it up and set it up. Even though it took like only a minute to set it up. It came a little charged, enough that we could call from our cell phones and have some fun. The directions were easy to read and understand. I needed the directions to know how to change the ring tone and make my own message for the answering machine. It was so simple. And so fun. I have the kiddos singing on it this time. We will probably change it a lot. The caller ID works great. The phone is in wonderful new condition as should be and fits lovely in the holder. We are happy with out phone. I especially like that ringer is not too loud or annoying. I would recommend this phone."

This one fits right over the round pegs that were installed by the phone company years ago.  The black models had the plastic \"basket\" that the unit sat in and the basket fit over the mounts making it difficult to read as it was not angled down and the phone company wall mount is for an older model of kitchen phone which just slipped on and hung at the right height.

It does not have a speaker option. She is used to pressing a button to hear her messages. The whole circle thing threw her off a bit. Perhaps I just could not find it, but it did not seem to be able to choose how many rings before the answering machine picks up. The default is 2 or 3 rings. I found the menu to set the ring tone and loudness but not the number. If I am wrong please let me know. I did not have enough time to go through all the instructions. So if any of the above matters to you I would just do a little more research on it."

And it's so tiny it fits in very small spaces, which is a plus for me since I have very little room for a phone at my house. It also glows in the dark when it's on, making it easy to use and the ringer's very loud, so those hard of hearing will be able to hear it ring.

        "I needed a home phone for emergency use.  My cable company bundles the landline in with the service, but theirs broke and was expensive to replace so I bought this.  I use it for very few things, 1. The cell phone batteries die 2. I need to call an 800 number and 3. I don't want to give some one my cell phone (like a business when I order something.  Or the credit card company.)As far as what I expect a landline telephone to do, it does it.  It was easy to plug in my router.  It makes calls.  It rings.Yeah, about the ringing.  It comes in two volumes, really super annoyingly loud, and loud.  Those are your two options (besides having it not ring it all, which, sometimes I need to have people call me back or what not so it's not really an option).  I have a very tiny apartment, so maybe that's the reason it sounds so loud.  But the \"low\" setting... it's loud.  I thought changing the ring-tone might help.  That I could find one at the low/load level that at least SOUNDED less obtrusive.  Look, I know it's a landline and there is a limit to the ringtones it can do.  But, while the original ringtone is annoying enough, the demented minds behind the low/loud ringtone have come up with the most annoying sounds I've ever heard.  Each is worse than the last.  I recommend buying this phone to listen to how laughably annoying they think you want your \"low\" ringtone to be. And the keypad is loud too.  I mean, high pitched reminds you of the alarm clock going off annoying and loud kind of noise.  You have the ability to turn the keypad noise off, however.  You want to do that.  Immediately.The menu is very confusing to navigate.  To get out of a particular sub-menu, you press \"off\".  Odd, as one naturally thinks of a \"back\" or \"clear\" and the \"off\" being the ultimate menu killer, but... okay.But the super annoying thing I hate is the lack of speakerphone.  As I said, I use this phone if I need to do something like, call a business.  Where I am on hold.  And I don't want to hear the annoying musak up against my ear.  THIS HAS NO SPEAKERPHONE.  I knew this going in from the other reviews, and for the price I thought I didn't really \"need\" a speaker phone.  But, now I miss it.So, if you're looking for a basic of the basic of the basic phone at the cheapest price you can get, this is it.  It has a small memory, which isn't so terrible as anyone I want to put in it IS on my cell phone anyway.So, it gets beyond one star because it does it's job.  It's a phone, it rings, it connects, it dials.  The connection is actually pretty clear.  I don't have problems hearing people or static.  You can adjust the volume while talking to people (turn off the annoying keypad first).  So as a phone, it earned it's two stars.As for everything else...."

In 1981 I liked Uniden however I don't think they kept up with VTech.Setting aside price for a second, VTech gear has out lasted in operation others. I had a VTech from 1998 that I finally dumped not because it quit. The tech was too old and wanted to get into DECT Version (I don't remember).... I do remember I still had it in Mexico in 2006 before giving it away.This unit, for the money (< $20 landed) is just what I needed, 0 more. Sure it would be nice if it had a speakerphone (no). And it doesn't have the bulk of an Answering machine I don't want or need. Yes, it has a msg waiting light for your 'cloud' based VM.Another +, the battery had enough juice to hook it up and make sure Magic Jack was setup properly. Now quietly charging.I'd double the starts and take one off for no speakerphone if I could.Suggestions to VTech for future refinement.Don't ship a 5V 300MA  adapter with a pin. Use micro USB for charging and terminate the cable to a standard USB B (full sized blade) and ship with a AC to USB charger. Rational is Magic Jack, etc. Now the MJ+ is in the router. If I hit the road, and I could power the VTech this way, I would have a regular headset attached to the USB for power and the Magic Jack+  for VoIP. 'll probably solder up and adapter for mine. <Oh, void the warranty, oh my -$15 device cannot be returned>. Shipping would be?Sound quality over Magic Jack is actually pretty good.VTech has certainly stayed up with the changing times. I hope to see more of them."

Great range in our huge backyard and up 3 flights indoors: huge extended range better than the 5.8GHz phones or 2.4GHzs. Answering machine is the easiest we've ever used: huge simple buttons(no long steps to go through: a button for delete, a button to skip, a button to play,and a button to repeat!), very large display of how many messages came in and easy to tell at a glance IF you have one! 14 minutes of messages. No tape to deal with. DECT 6.0 technology so it doesn't get interference from wireless etc. The handset is so comfortable to hold unlike many other new cordless models. The white color is easy to find in a dimly lit room. The backlit keypad and display are way brighter than other brands, and the keypads are completely lit up, not just the lettering. Great for calls at night or dimly lit rooms. Wall mountable is nice. It's really easy to put the handset back in the cradle in a hurry after a call, unlike others that fall out easily or you have to have it just so or it won't charge correctly. The design is such that when you set it down it won't bump the keys & dial accidentally; I hate that with our other cordless brands! Very sturdy, durable phone (been through 3 moves without a hitch). Extra loud volume on handset and also on answering machine & caller ID: I wear hearing aids but it has been just fine. Menu is exceptionally easy to run through to change settings. It's also hearing aid compatible (T-cell) and it's even a \"green\" phone: it's recyclable and has a non-toxic coating it says. Many cordless phones have frustrated us for various reasons; this phone is a joy to have."

This phone is a disappointment from beginning to end and I love Vtech! When you are dialing out there is a one to two second delay between the push of the button to the tone of the pushed button.  This makes it very confusing.  To dial out you have to push the number extremely hard and wait a few seconds until you push another number or the phone does not catch the second dialed number. There is no speed dial. I didn't know phones existed anymore that didn't have this feature. There are no instructions on how to remove numbers stored in the directory and as of now I have not discovered one either. The display is very hard to read and I have good eyes. If this phone is set too close to a computer and rings there is a great deal of interference.  You can hear loud humming in the computers speakers. Trust me, you DO NOT get what you paid for with this phone. Go a couple bucks more and get a phone that works!"

        "I've had this phone for a few years, I'm not sure if they've updated it but I really dislike this phone system. My wife randomly picked out the cheapest phone in the store.......-The sound on it is mediocre and cuts out a little with soft voices.-there is no speaker mode for calls on the handset or base unit-the caller ID doesn't always log the call in its memory. Sometimes I'll receive a call and once the call ends(either answered or went to voicemail), if I check the call log, that call wont be listed.-the answering machine playback doesn't list the date of the call. It will say the day of the week and the time but not the numerical date or month which annoys me.Overall its a cheap phone that does work and hes been operational for roughly 6 years but I'm waiting for the day that it breaks so I can replace it."

        "I bought this to replace a failed Caller ID unit and to act as a light-use extension in a VOIP setup. It works fine for that, except the LCD screen is pretty bad: very small type, non-adjustable contrast, and a backlight so weak I had to shut myself in a dark room to see if it was working at all. In two days of use I've had no issues with sound or battery life -- the manual does say it needs to charge for 16 hours. Speaking of the manual, go find the online one; it has lots of important info about ways to delete all calls from the log and other useful stuff. Additional tip: if the power fails, don't bother pushing the zillions of buttons to set date and time again. Just wait for an incoming call and it takes care of it by itself.For the price it is an acceptable phone, but my much older Vtech multi-handset with answering machine is head and shoulders above it. Did they sell the company and outsource everything?"

        "I don't know what the other reviewers of this phone are having a problem with.  I have a very small studio here in New York City  and I have a currently free landline compliments of Google Voice (at least for the time being) and an OBI110.  I have a great 4A Speakerphone from western Electric as an extension on the line and I use it for most of my conversation, but i needed a simple cordless phone for occasional talking.  This phone sounds great and I've experienced NO interference or static with it.  This is simple, no frills Cordless phone that fill the bill for me.  It's very minimal.  The only complaint I would give it was that it took an entire 8 hours to charge.  Since then it's worked flawlessly on my VOIP line.  Maybe the situation would be different in a larger area, but the signal is strong.  If you have DSL phone service (Which I don't), you will need a DSL filter on most cordless phones so that may be the issue with the other reviews.  Just my 2 Cents.Simple PhoneWorks as Advertised!"

        "LOVE! I only needed a 1 handset phone, as I  typically have my calls forwarded to my cell. And sometimes I need to use the handset when making a call that will be a long one! This is a GREAT phone for the price! ( It is even on sale now! 12-19-15) I had my last 2 handset phone for about 8 years, and killed them both! (It wasn't a great brand name to begin with...and it would have cost more to replace both batteries than to purchase this one!) I talk a lot, as I am in the music biz! I find the quality of the sound to be perfect, and there is zero static. (Although I do have the filters that came with my laptop modem,) the keypad lights up, which is a great addition,and it has caller ID  as well. Holds 30 messages and 30#'s too!All in all. GREAT phone for the price! Thank You Amazon for this offering, I am well pleased with this product. And highly recommend it. :D"

        "This is my 2nd Vtech of a similar model in 5 years. The last one croaked quite suddenly, too. This one I made certain to unhook as soon as thunder rumbled. Now my online service and computer are working fine, but the phone will not work at all, and it's been charging for hours. It shows the same weird message on the screen over and over again: \"Out of range,\" etc. As if it isn't hooked up! I've tried re-doing its hookup 3 different times. I've only had this phone since Xmas time, so there is absolutely no excuse for it croaking on me this way.Everything else hooked up to the same power strip is working just fine, so it cannot be the strip. And my source for online connection is the same as for the phone. Like I say, it makes no sense. Why'd it up and croak on me? I am ultra disappointed, and am a disabled person as well, so I did not need the added bother or worry. This was my one connection to the outside world beyond the internet. Very upsetting. I will not be buying this brand again (bargain tho' it may have been) as long as I can find something better for about the same price. The connectors at the bottom appear either to have been loosely put together or else be faulty. And I am not a rough person by nature, tending to be careful with anything I invest in. Will be comparing brands online till I can find the right one. Meantime, let's hope I can get by without a phone!"

The voice quality is very good - it's light and comfortable to hold for extended periods (I have some contacts that go on forever!)  However, it has two drawbacks: 1. the sound made when pressing the keypad buttons is the most obnoxious sqwauking sound imaginable.  I cringe every time I have to dial with it.  2. the back lit screen is hardly that.  The buttons light up enough to serve as a nightlight, but the screen is unreadable with only a very dim light behind it.

        "Great inexpensive cordless system.The Good:It has caller ID with call waiting ID which was the main feature I was looking for. I was able to find it in black as well. Name and number phone book, caller ID phone book matching. The backlit keypad and LCD is great since I plan on also using the handset in a bedroom when I'm not feeling well. The operation is rather simple. The phone has four ringtones for those using multiple phones on multiple lines. The phone feels comfortable to hold hinging on a bit too light for my taste.The Bad:The ringer is very very weak, if this is an issue get an extension ringer, this was enough to ding a star. In my case it is a mixed blessing since I live at home, but have my own VoIP line and ringing won't likely disturb them, but not being able to hear the ringer from another room is likely an issue. No belt clip, something I would have expected on a modern phone, but again for the price I can't be too picky. Lastly, it takes a plug in battery, I'm kind of spoiled with my parents' cordless system that uses standard rechargeable AAA cells, just something to be aware of.The FYI:The battery takes 16 hours to charge, just keep this in mind. This is bad due to the time needed, but is better for the longevity of the battery."

        "This phone is okay and you'll be hard-pressed to find something less expensive. But compared to my Uniden, which I purchased a couple of years ago for the same price, the screen is smaller so its harder to see what's going on. Using functions like adding a directory entry is not as intuitive as it could be. Biggest disappointment is that it advertises that it alerts you when you have a voicemail waiting. It does this by putting a message on the screen, as opposed to the Uniden which visibly flashes - so unless you walk over to the phone and pick it up to examine the small screen you wouldn't know. If you purchase this phone I suggest you do an online search for the user manual. The one that comes with the phone is not detailed enough."

Note that I'm using a VOIP phone setup.Setting up the phone was easy.  Getting it to work was another matter.  At first, the ringer worked correctly.  But in the space of a week, and while my VOIP setup recognized an incoming call was coming in, the phone didn't ring.  And after that, it would no longer allow me to make outgoing calls.  So, I took it back to the store - asking them if they had another single-headset cordless phone that was not made by VTech.  They referred me to a Panasonic unit which is also sold on Amazon at:Panasonic KX-TGD210N DECT 6.0 1.9 GHz Expandable Digital Cordless Phone with 1 Handset, Champagne GoldAnd since the day I bought it, this unit has consistently worked great on incoming and outgoing calls.

I got my toughbox about 2 weeks ago, and hooked the phone up. It lit up, and I was able to set the ring tone, add people to my call log, etc... I used it with my MagicJack, and thought it was because I had a slow internet connection that the sound quality was poor. Reading the other reviews, it appears that it was just the handset.

I purchased it to replace a much older Panasonic wireless phone (2 phones) and the Vtech is considerably less in price.Seems most reviewers have complained about there not being a speaker function. Well, if you wanted a speaker phone then you should have read the package and not purchased this phone. The Panasonic I'm replacing this with didn't have a speaker function either. I didn't miss it then and I don't miss it now. Obviously I don't have a use for it. I've an iPhone 5s and it does have a speaker function & I don't use that function often. I'm very close to eliminating my land line phone anyway and chose this Vtech wireless mostly because batteries needed replacement on the Panasonic and for the price of a new pair I'd rather go for a new phone. Also for the convenience of having a phone on each level of my home. As to it being made in China. Jeez, where would I get a phone that isn't and what would it cost? When Ma Bell was around we had the best phones ever made. But the government fixed that and we've now got China.Having said the foregoing I have to report that installation of this phone was a breeze and it's working just fine. it's an answering machine, too, for when I'm out in the field.

Sure enough, I've confirmed today - it sometimes just doesn't ring when a call's coming in. Since it was an important call I missed the first time, I sat with the handset in my hand and watched for the call to come through. It appeared on the screen, but no ring.

I'm not sure exactly when this problem started, since I'm usually not watching the caller ID screen waiting for a call. It's an intermittent problem - I've heard it ring as much as 6 times (even though my voicemail is supposed to pick up before that) when it's a call I know I don't want to answer, and I've heard it ring about a half a ring and then stop - and when I go to the phone to check who called, the caller's still there (i.e., it should still be ringing).It also picks up a lot of noise, but that's probably true for all cordless phones."

I unplugged for a minute, then plugged it back in with the handset in the base.  The 'in use' light would come on for a couple seconds then go off.  Still got the same message when trying to make a call.  I tried other things, to no avail.I won't say that when you go cheap you get what you pay for, because I bought some bottom dollar stuff in the past that works well to this day.

If you need to listen to an automated system you can sometimes barely hear it and sometimes hear almost NOTHING.  It does NOT have speaker phone, and the buttons are hard to press, I've had it for almost a year and I have to press the buttons extra hard.  It also takes a long time to clear itself.  For instance, if the buttons weren't working correctly (too hard to push) and I want to hang up and call again, I HAVE to give the phone several seconds or I won't get dial tone.  Also the battery life is terrible, I moved and it wasn't plugged in for maybe a day and it dies now after an hour.  The call log and redial options are also worthless as it does not hold enough info.

It's no longer holding a charge properly. The icing on the cake: it has no speaker phone feature. While that's not a must, it is slightly annoying."

If you don't mind your calls being listened in on, then it will suit your needs, but I like my security and privacy so I am buying a more secure one, and not using this one !"
